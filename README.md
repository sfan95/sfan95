### Hello!
I’m a UC Berkeley undergraduate with a strong interest in the intersection of computer science, data science, and neuroscience/psychology, particularly in relation to education and healthcare.

I work at Neuroscape at UCSF, a lab that focuses on addressing memory loss and other cognitive issues by using computer science, game design, and medical technology. I’ve contributed to a spatial-memory game called Labyrinth there and I’m deeply passionate about finding even more effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases through technology.

I'm also currently a head TA for CS61A, where I help manage the course logistics and coordinate tutor coverage for 1800+ students.

I love anything related to biotechnology, data science, or tech for social good -- please reach out to me at sherryfansf@berkeley.edu if you would like to talk!
